# The DigiMember Plugin 

This plugin is distributed to your customers. It is also used for selling itself (running on digimember.de - in connection with the DigiServer plugin).

## Setting up your development environment
* Setup wordpress on your local machine
* Clone this repo to YOUR-WP-PATH/wp-content/plugins/digimember (rename plugin.digimember to digimember)
* goto to system/config/environment and copy debug.php.dist to debug.php. Adjust debug.php to your needs.

If you want to work on the license server, you may want to setup two DigiMember installations - one as a client installation (as used by our customers) and one as a server installation (as running on digimember.de).
